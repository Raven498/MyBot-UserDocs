## Introduction
MyBot is a Discord bot that provides various "subservices" involving music, server moderation/management, an RPG text game, etc. MyBot provides many commands to use these services, so this website serves as a reference for users to look up commands and understand what they do. This website organizes all of our commands into the subservices they are a part of and provides detailed information regarding their proper use and functionality.

MyBot's command prefix is `*`. If a command requires more than one parameter, make sure to enclose your parameters in double quotes (`""`).
